Fallout Weapons aims to continue the legacy left behind by Project Fallout. I'm seeking to add in weapons and solely weapons from the Fallout universe; namely New Vegas, 3, and 4. I seek to make this mod Combat Enhanced compatible from the ground up. For the time being, the patch WILL throw up errors if you don't have CE loaded. But, this is normal and the mod will work even with the errors.

The graphics for the time being is meant to be a palceholder. In the future, they will be replaced. So any comments you might have for the artstyle would be greatly appreciated

Future things to add include apparel, and chems. Further than that, I suggest you take a look at Fallout Core for the time being. In the future, I might invest more time into this mod.
